-------------------------general instruction -------------------------
- The "secret_keys.py" file contains:
	SECRET_KEY='secret-key'
	PASSWORD='admin'
	DATABASE='flight_db'

-------------------------instructions how to run with docker-------------------------
download 'docker-compose.yml' from git
open VSC to the directory of the docker-compose file location

'docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build'
'docker ps'
//identify the line of mysql image and check on the last column what is the name of that container it should be "project2-flight-dockerdb-1"
'docker exec -ti project2-flight-dockerdb-1 mysql -u root -p'
insert password: "admin"
'create database flight_db;'
'use flight_db;'
'ctrl+d' for exit
'docker ps'
//under NAMES column identify the line of "flask-container" and take the container_ID, to replace in the next line in order to create tables and insert data to DB
'docker exec -ti 636517c39d84 bash'
'python DB_Creation_SQLAlchemy/create_tables.py'
'ctrl+d'

now you can open http://localhost:3000/ and wait 10 minutes - it can take a wail



------------using the website---------
I created 3 different users and even more for your use: 
	customer email: ofir6bd@gmail.com	
	admin email: admin1234@gmail.com
	airline email: El_Al_company@gmail.com
	for all users in DB the password is "1qaz2wsx"

-------------------------general info-------------------------
I didn't gave comments for every function since the name of the functions it's self explanatory
Postman queries exported to the main folder as "Postman-Flight-project.postman_collection.json"
- The date range search for a specific date it's 3 days forward and one day before
- At the beginning I worked on the website in the flask application with templates forms and all.
	later after I changed some functions for react, I don't know what is the status of the flask website and it dosen't matter "http://localhost:5000/"
	but just for you to know I keep the structure for it maybe for later use (as comment of course)
