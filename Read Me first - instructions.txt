-------------------------general info-------------------------
I didn't gave comments for every function since the name of the function is self explenatory
Postman queries exported to the main folder as "Postman-Flight-project.postman_collection.json"
- The date range search for a specific date it's 3 days forward and one day before
- At the begining I worked on the website in the flask application with templates forms and all.
	later after I changed some functions for react website, I don't know what is the status of the flask website and it dosen't matter "http://localhost:5000/"
	but just for you to know I keeped the structure for it maybe for later use.
